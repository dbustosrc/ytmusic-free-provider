"""Assert the provider still loads against the real Music Assistant server package.

Run inside the image built by ``Dockerfile``, which is
``FROM ghcr.io/music-assistant/server:<MA_VERSION>`` with the provider copied into
site-packages, so the interpreter there has the genuine server package::

    docker run --rm -i --entrypoint /app/venv/bin/python \\
        local-test-image:latest - < tests/verify_server_contract.py

Nothing else in CI executes these imports. ``tests/python`` replaces
``music_assistant`` with a stub in ``conftest.py``, and the models-contract job
installs only ``music_assistant_models``. The server package is not published on
PyPI at all (upstream ships it as a GitHub release asset), so this image is the
only cheap place a real import can happen. Issue #66.

Deliberately not folded into ``tests/ma_contract.py``. That table describes
``music_assistant_models`` and is imported by two pytest suites; this runs inside
the container, where the tests directory is not mounted. Staying self-contained
is what lets it be piped in on stdin.

Not named ``test_*.py`` on purpose: ``pytest.ini`` sets ``testpaths = tests/python``
and ``python_files = test_*.py``, and this must not be collected by a suite whose
whole premise is that the server package is stubbed out.
